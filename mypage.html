    <h1>Arugonda, Vamshi</h1>
    <p>
        1. I'm in the top 10 for collegiate sailors in Colorado (there's only about 10 of us)</br>
        2. I collect Monopoly Boards, I have over 20</br>
        3. I can solve a Rubik's cube in about 30 seconds</br>
        </br>
        I'm studying computer science because I enjoy puzzles! Comp Sci, to me, is a lot of debugging which is basically just solving puzzles.</br>
        Coding is also the closest we can get to creating in the most open-ended sense of the word. I enjoy being able to sit down and make just about anything.
